# Dockerfiles

## Introduction:

Inside these folders are the dockerfiles needed to create the images of OO SS, with compilers and SSH enabled, used by jenkins to run the designed processes in the continuous integration system.
We use 3 different operating systems, but for each one of them, we create images of the distributions which have support.
